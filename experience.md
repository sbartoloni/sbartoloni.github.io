<p style="text-align:right;">I did my undergraduate work in Chemistry with a minor in Environmental Science at Cal Poly - San Luis Obispo. During my undergraduate carrer I explored different applications of water chemistry with the hope of one day studying climate change. My main research fouced on studying the spatial distribution of carbonate chemistry in the Morro Bay estuary. Through this project, I learned how to collect samples with a CTD - Rosette and analyze seawater for pH, dissolved inorganic carbon, and total alkalinity. Outside of research, I co-led the American Sign Language club, was an activity member the professional chemistry fraternity Alpha Chi Sigma, and was a learning assistant and tutor for general chemistry courses.</p>
