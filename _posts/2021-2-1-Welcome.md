My name is Sarah Bartoloni and I am currently a PhD student at the University of South Florida in Dr. Nancy William's lab. My research is focused on the biogeochemistry of mesoscale eddies in the Southern Ocean. I am particularly interested in how eddies trap and transport carbon in frontal regions. 

When I am not learning python, you can find me enjoying the Florida weather by playing tennis, visiting the beach, or exploring the beatiful parks in St. Pete.
